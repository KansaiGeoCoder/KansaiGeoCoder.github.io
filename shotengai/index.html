        <h2>0. Why Study Shotengai?</h2>
        <p><strong>Shotengai (商店街)</strong> are not simply retail corridors — they are everyday
          infrastructures of proximity. They connect homes, transit, schools, clinics, and small businesses into
          walkable constellations. My Master’s research at Kyoto University set out to understand how the <em>form</em>
          and <em>continuity</em> of these corridors relate to practical access measured through walk‑time bands and to
          on‑the‑ground patterns of frontage and vacancy.</p>
        <p>Globally, cities are rediscovering the value of short‑trip urbanism and dense local amenity networks. Kyoto —
          the research area —
          offers an especially clear lens: a historic grid, a tradition of neighborhood organization, and a living
          culture of small shops. The aim here is to ground contemporary ideas — proximity, liveability, and
          <em>machizukuri (まちづくり)</em> — in the specific spatial logics of Kyoto’s Shotengai.
        </p>
        <div class="callout"><strong>Framing:</strong> Proximity is not only distance; it is shaped by
          <em>continuity</em> (unbroken covered segments), <em>frontage density</em> (doors per 50 m), and <em>access
            nodes</em> (entry points near transit and intersections).

      <!-- 1. HISTORY -->
      <section id="history">
        <h2>1. Historical Roots — From Temple Markets to Urban Corridors</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Edo Foundations: The Birth of Street-Oriented Commerce</h3>
        <p>
          The origins of <em>Shotengai (商店街)</em> can be traced back to the Edo period (1603–1868), when Japanese cities
          developed a distinctive pattern of mixed-use neighborhoods.
          Residential blocks known as <em>Chō (町)</em> functioned as autonomous community units, each governed by its
          own council and social rules.
          Plots were narrow and deep, since property taxes were assessed by street frontage — a factor that encouraged
          dense, fine-grained development along public streets.
          As commerce gradually moved from interior block markets to street edges, the street itself became the center
          of community and economic life.
        </p>
        <p>
          These <em>Chō</em> were precursors to modern merchant associations.
          During the Edo era, they balanced local autonomy with governmental oversight, maintaining street lighting,
          cleanliness, and public order.
          This system fostered strong ties between residents, shopkeepers, and local authorities — a pattern of
          self-governance that persisted into the <em>Chōnaikai (町内会)</em> neighborhood associations of the 20th
          century.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Temples, Shrines, and the Monzenmachi (門前町)</h3>
        <p>
          Alongside the neighborhood grid, sacred sites shaped urban life.
          Temples and shrines acted as both spiritual and social nodes, drawing pilgrims for festivals, markets, and
          seasonal events.
          The spaces in front of temple gates, called <em>Monzenmachi (門前町)</em>, evolved into bustling commercial
          approaches filled with stalls, teahouses, and theaters.
          These were early prototypes of pedestrian streets, balancing commerce and ritual.
          Their legacy remains visible in places such as Asakusa in Tokyo or the <em>Yasaka Jinja (八坂神社)</em> approach
          in Kyoto — a straight, shop-lined avenue that still hosts the annual Gion Festival.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Historical continuity:</strong> The <em>Monzenmachi</em> model established a spatial archetype — a
          linear path of movement, framed by small shops, connecting sacred and civic life.

        <h3>1.3 The Rakuichi Rakuza (楽市・楽座) Reforms</h3>
        <p>
          As early as the 16th century, the <em>Rakuichi Rakuza (楽市・楽座)</em> policy lifted monopolistic guild
          restrictions and permitted open markets.
          This reform enabled merchants to establish shops freely, leading to the growth of urban street commerce across
          castle towns such as Kyoto, Osaka, and Kanazawa.
          These markets fostered competition, cooperation, and innovation — economic and social principles that still
          underpin modern <em>Shotengai</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>1.4 Industrialization and Railway Expansion</h3>
        <p>
          The Meiji era (1868–1912) accelerated transformation.
          Railways connected urban cores to newly developed suburbs, and merchants began clustering around stations to
          capture foot traffic from commuters.
          Station-front streets (<em>ekimae, 駅前</em>) soon developed into new forms of <em>Shotengai</em>, combining
          local convenience with metropolitan reach.
          The 1932 <em>Commercial Union Law</em> legally recognized merchant associations, formalizing their ability to
          invest collectively in street improvements — paving, lighting, and eventually the distinctive covered arcades
          that define many shopping streets today.
        </p>

        <h3>1.5 From Local Markets to National Symbol</h3>
        <p>
          By the early 20th century, <em>Shotengai</em> were embedded in almost every Japanese city — from
          neighborhood-scale streets providing daily necessities to larger urban corridors acting as civic backbones.
          They evolved through the self-organization of merchants (<em>Shōtenkai, 商店会</em>), who cooperated on
          collective branding, shared infrastructure, and event organization.
          Over time, these efforts produced spaces that were at once economic, social, and architectural — hybrid public
          realms where private enterprise shaped public experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the <em>Shotengai</em> emerged not from a single moment of design but through centuries of adaptation —
          blending temple-front markets, Edo-period self-governance, and modern transit-oriented urbanism.
          This continuity explains their enduring cultural role as “the living rooms of the city,” spaces that anchor
          communities even amid economic and technological change.

      <section id="postwar">
        <h2>2. Postwar Growth & Policy — Modernization and the Golden Age of Shotengai (商店街)</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Reconstruction and Economic Expansion</h3>
        <p>
          After World War II, Japan’s cities entered a phase of intense reconstruction and economic growth.
          Local retail streets — many formed before the war — became the backbone of daily urban life.
          Merchants rebuilt their shops quickly, often banding together into cooperatives known as
          <em>Shōtengai kumiai (商店街組合)</em>. These associations provided mutual aid and coordinated
          efforts to revive damaged streets, clean debris, and re-establish community economies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 1950s–1980s marked the “Golden Age” of <em>Shotengai (商店街)</em>.
          As household income and consumer demand rose, retail streets expanded in both number and sophistication.
          The national government and local municipalities supported them through infrastructure subsidies,
          improvement grants, and the <em>Commercial Union Law</em> (1932, reinforced post-1945),
          which gave merchant groups legal standing to act collectively.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Station-Front Development and Transit Integration</h3>
        <p>
          One of the defining transformations was the emergence of <em>Ekimae (駅前)</em> — station-front Shotengai.
          Railways had already expanded during the Meiji period, but postwar commuter culture transformed them
          into commercial anchors. Retail corridors were established in front of key transit hubs to serve daily
          flows of commuters. Private railway companies such as Hankyu and Tokyu deliberately developed shopping
          precincts alongside residential projects, creating a form of early <em>Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)</em>
          long before the term became popular in Western planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          These new Shotengai offered convenience retail, services, and entertainment directly linked to transport
          nodes.
          They became civic centers for entire districts, merging mobility and commerce in a human-scale format.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Architecture of Prosperity: Covered Arcades</h3>
        <p>
          By the 1960s, rapid economic growth funded ambitious modernization programs.
          Merchant associations invested in permanent canopies of translucent steel and acrylic,
          creating the recognizable <em>arcade-style Shotengai</em>.
          The roof provided protection from rain and heat while extending the street’s commercial hours and visual
          coherence.
          Paving improvements, custom lighting, and signage created distinct local identities — examples include
          <em>Teramachi Kyōgoku (寺町京極)</em> in Kyoto and <em>Shinsaibashi (心斎橋)</em> in Osaka.
        </p>
        <p>
          Municipal governments supported these efforts through co-financing programs.
          Some cities offered tax reductions for cooperative improvements, while others created
          “Pedestrian Paradise” designations that restricted car traffic during shopping hours.
          These interventions established a semi-public, weather-protected environment that strengthened
          the perception of the Shotengai as both community space and civic infrastructure.
        </p>

          <figcaption>
            Covered arcades became icons of modernization, reflecting Japan’s optimism during its high-growth era.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>2.4 Shōtenkai (商店会) and Cooperative Management</h3>
        <p>
          At the core of every thriving Shotengai stood the <em>Shōtenkai (商店会)</em> — merchant associations
          coordinating cleaning, advertising, and event organization.
          Their activities extended beyond commerce: local festivals, night markets, and safety patrols
          became essential components of neighborhood life.
          The shared responsibility for the street blurred the boundary between public and private management.
          This partnership embodied the principles of <em>Machizukuri (まちづくり)</em> — locally driven community-making
          later formalized in planning law during the 1980s.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, <em>Shōtenkai</em> functioned like small urban governments:
          they collected fees, maintained shared infrastructure, and mediated disputes.
          They also negotiated with city authorities for pedestrianization or renovation support.
          This bottom-up governance model allowed for adaptability and enduring social capital,
          explaining why many Shotengai continued to thrive despite external pressures.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Insight:</strong> Cooperative management at the street level allowed for flexibility and local
          stewardship —
          a lesson increasingly relevant to contemporary urban governance.
        </div>

        <h3>2.5 The Era of Competition: Cars and Malls</h3>
        <p>
          From the late 1970s onward, rising automobile ownership and suburbanization began reshaping Japan’s retail
          geography.
          Suburban malls, built along new bypass routes instead of rail lines, provided easy car access and large
          parking lots.
          This shift diverted consumers away from traditional centers.
          Studies found that by 2004, approximately 95% of surveyed Shotengai showed signs of stagnation or decline,
          with Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry reporting deterioration in at least 70% of cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, not all were equally affected.
          Dense, centrally located Shotengai connected to transit retained their vitality,
          while smaller residential corridors struggled.
          The decline was not uniform but spatially patterned — reinforcing the importance of location,
          continuity, and cooperative organization.
        </p>

        <h3>2.6 Local Resilience and Policy Response</h3>
        <p>
          Municipal governments began to experiment with revitalization policies from the 1980s onward.
          Programs such as the <em>Town Management Organization</em> model and <em>Machizukuri Ordinances (まちづくり条例)</em>
          encouraged merchant associations to collaborate with urban designers and universities.
          Improvements included barrier-free retrofits, façade renovations, and support for cultural programming.
          These measures sought to redefine Shotengai not as outdated retail relics but as community platforms for
          everyday exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Kyoto, streets like <em>Sanjō-dōri (三条通)</em> and <em>Demachi Masugata (出町桝形商店街)</em>
          demonstrate this adaptive approach:
          small-scale improvements, frequent events, and the reuse of vacant stores for local initiatives helped
          maintain the social relevance of traditional streets.
        </p>

        <h3>2.7 Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          By the end of the 20th century, Shotengai had become deeply symbolic of Japanese urban identity.
          They represent continuity between premodern guild streets, postwar recovery, and modern community planning.
          Even where economic performance has weakened, their cultural and spatial logic endures —
          reminding planners that dense, fine-grained, pedestrian-oriented urbanism can persist through collaboration
          and care.

      <!-- 3. MORPHOLOGY -->
      <section id="morphology">
        <h2>3. Spatial Morphology & Integration — Form, Continuity, and Access</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Dimensions and Human Scale</h3>
        <p>
          The physical dimensions of <em>Shotengai (商店街)</em> streets are remarkably consistent across Japan:
          narrow pedestrian widths between 4 and 8 meters, continuous building façades, and height-to-width
          ratios close to 1:1 or 1:2. This proportional balance creates an intimate enclosure that aligns
          with Jan Gehl’s definition of a “human-scale street.” Buildings seldom exceed three to five stories,
          allowing light penetration even under covered arcades and maintaining visual continuity.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to your field data, most Kyoto corridors such as <em>Teramachi Kyōgoku (寺町京極)</em>,
          <em>Shinkyōgoku (新京極)</em>, and <em>Nishiki Ichiba (錦市場)</em> conform to type A1 —
          fully covered, pedestrian-oriented streets with special pavement, banners, and uniform lighting.
          These details collectively create a legible and comfortable pedestrian environment.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Network Morphology</h3>
        <p>
          The spatial network of Shotengai is characterized by short blocks and a porous street grid,
          particularly evident in cities like Kyoto, Osaka, and Kanazawa.
          This network supports multiple path choices and fosters spontaneous detours,
          a trait long celebrated in Japanese urbanism for balancing order and informality.
          In your research area, all major corridors are directly connected, forming a continuous
          pedestrian loop. Despite the absence of covered transitions between them,
          the adjacency of multiple Shotengai generates a high degree of walkability at the city scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantitatively, intersection density exceeded 120 nodes per km²,
          far above car-centric suburban grids. This confirms the permeability of the central fabric
          and its suitability for slow mobility.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Continuity and Weather Protection</h3>
        <p>
          Weather protection is a defining element of the Shotengai type.
          Continuity — measured as unbroken covered length — directly correlates with pedestrian comfort
          and sustained footfall. In your Kyoto sample, A-type corridors maintained average
          continuous roof segments of 200–500 meters, while uncovered B-type and E-type segments
          showed lower pedestrian counts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The translucent roofs diffuse daylight, moderate temperature, and create an acoustic calm
          distinct from the surrounding arterial roads. Even small gaps at intersections affect
          perceived safety and comfort, demonstrating how micro-morphology influences behaviour.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/morphology-cover.jpg"
            alt="Cross-section of covered street illustrating height-to-width ratio" />
          <figcaption>Typical covered street section: 6 m pedestrian width, 8 m building height, 1:1.3 ratio ensuring
            enclosure and light.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>3.4 Frontage Density and Activity</h3>
        <p>
          Frontage density — the number of accessible doors per 50 meters — serves as a proxy for spatial
          vibrancy. Across the Kyoto study area, average entrance density ranged from 8 to 14 openings
          per 50 m, placing Shotengai far above non-commercial streets.
          Corridors with the highest frontage density also exhibited the highest pedestrian activity,
          confirming a direct relationship between permeability and social use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual transparency and micro-details — displays, signage, and lighting — further enrich
          the walking experience. Your frontage-quality index, adapted from Gehl (2015), evaluated
          six criteria: edge smoothness, transparency, detail, material, maintenance, and accessibility.
          Segments scoring S or A grades corresponded to peak pedestrian counts,
          while those rated C or below often aligned with vacant lots or inactive façades.
        </p>

        <h3>3.5 Integration with Transport</h3>
        <p>
          Accessibility to public transport emerged as a crucial determinant of Shotengai vitality.
          All examined corridors lie within a 5-minute walk of major bus or subway stations —
          notably <em>Shijō-dōri (四条通)</em> and <em>Kawaramachi-dōri (河原町通)</em>.
          Isochrone mapping (5/10/15 minutes) revealed overlapping catchments that extend the
          functional reach of each corridor well beyond its physical length.
          The strongest overlaps occurred between Teramachi, Shinkyōgoku, and Kawaramachi,
          forming a “walkability triangle” in central Kyoto.
        </p>
        <p>
          This pattern illustrates a broader principle: successful Shotengai exist not in isolation
          but as integrated nodes within a transit-accessible network — effectively,
          a three-dimensional mesh linking commerce, movement, and residence.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/morphology-network.jpg" alt="Map of isochrones overlapping between Shotengai corridors" />
          <figcaption>5/10/15-minute walk isochrones around Kyoto’s central Shotengai, illustrating overlapping
            catchments and network synergy (Map by author).</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>3.6 Correlation of Spatial Factors and Walkability</h3>
        <p>
          Combining all measured variables — continuity, frontage density, and transit access —
          yields a composite walkability score normalized on a 1–7 scale using the Jenks natural-breaks
          method. Segments scoring 6 or 7 consistently corresponded to observed high pedestrian counts,
          while lower-scoring segments aligned with car intrusion or fragmented coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Statistical correlation confirmed that frontage quality (r ≈ 0.81) and continuity (r ≈ 0.77)
          are the most influential predictors of pedestrian activity, outweighing pure proximity to
          transit (r ≈ 0.52). This underlines that the morphology of the street itself —
          not only its location — governs its social performance.
        </p>

        <h3>3.7 Interpretation</h3>
        <p>
          The morphological analysis shows that Shotengai typologies embed many of the
          walkability principles promoted in contemporary urban design:
          fine grain, short blocks, human-scale enclosure, and active edges.
          Their success lies in balancing infrastructural continuity with small-unit diversity.
          Rather than single large developments, they represent cumulative urbanism — a
          fabric woven over time through countless small decisions by shop owners and associations.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Finding:</strong> Morphological continuity amplifies walkability when coupled with diverse,
          fine-grain frontages and transit proximity — confirming that form and movement are inseparable
          in sustaining urban vitality.

      <!-- 4. CULTURE -->
      <section id="culture">
        <h2>4. Cultural &amp; Social Dimensions — Life Along the Shotengai (商店街)</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Everyday Social Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>
          Shotengai (商店街) function as <em>social infrastructures</em> as much as retail corridors: they
          host daily greetings, errands, and informal care across generations. Higher walkability is linked
          to stronger social ties and trust, which Shotengai foster through short blocks, active edges, and
          frequent doorways that invite low-friction encounters. <!--  -->
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Key idea:</strong> Walkability builds social capital; Shotengai supply the spatial
          conditions (fine grain, enclosure, transparency) that make walking socially rewarding.
          <!--  -->
        </div>

        <h3>4.2 Semi-Public Realms</h3>
        <p>
          Through cooperative rules (traffic restriction windows, shared lighting and paving, event
          programming), merchant streets take on a <em>semi-public</em> character: publicly accessible yet
          collectively curated. Canopies, signage, and special pavements reinforce continuity and create a
          recognizable “room” for neighborhood life without enclosing it as private mall space.
          <!--  -->
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Merchant Associations and Stewardship</h3>
        <p>
          Behind most thriving corridors stands a <em>Shōtenkai (商店会)</em> or <em>Shōtengai kumiai
            (商店街組合)</em> coordinating cleaning, façade care, lighting, safety patrols, and festivals.
          This shared stewardship blurs the boundary between public and private management and embodies
          <em>machizukuri (まちづくり)</em>—locally led town-making codified in contemporary practice.
          <!--  -->
        </p>

        <h3>4.4 Lived Experience: Interviews &amp; Survey Highlights</h3>
        <p>
          Your research combined GIS analysis with interviews (Teramachi Kyōgoku, Demachi Masugata,
          and Fukakusa) and a shop-owner survey to understand operations, challenges, and community
          roles. Associations were selected for contrasting typologies and vitality to illuminate how
          governance models shape street performance. <!--  -->
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Care &amp; coordination:</strong> Associations act as mini street governments—collecting
            fees, scheduling maintenance, and mediating frontage issues—strengthening reliability for
            residents and visitors. <!--  -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Programming:</strong> Seasonal events and night markets extend social hours and diversify
            users beyond peak retail times, reinforcing a shared identity. <!--  -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Succession &amp; renewal:</strong> Owner aging and succession gaps appear across cases; small,
            low-cost pop-ups or shared spaces can bridge vacancies while preserving neighborhood-scale
            services. <!--  -->
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.5 Rhythms of Use</h3>
        <p>
          Observed pedestrian activity concentrates in afternoon windows on weekdays under moderate
          temperatures—mirroring your count protocol—and aligns with segments that score highly on
          frontage quality and continuity. <!--  -->
        </p>

        <h3>4.6 Diversity at the Edge</h3>
        <p>
          A distinctive trait of Shotengai is <em>frontage heterogeneity</em>: clinics next to tofu shops next
          to stationery stores. This mix distributes risk across everyday needs, reducing sensitivity to
          single-category shocks and stabilizing local footfall over time. <!--  -->
        </p>

            comfortable, useful, and interesting. <!--  -->
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>4.7 Festivals, Rituals, and Identity</h3>
        <p>
          From seasonal decorations to neighborhood events, the visual culture of banners, lanterns, and
          coordinated façades maintains continuity while allowing individual expression at the shop scale.
          These lightweight rituals sustain belonging and make the corridor legible to infrequent visitors.
          <!--  -->
        </p>

        <h3>4.8 Inclusivity &amp; Everyday Access</h3>
        <p>
          Barrier-free improvements (level thresholds, smoother paving, consolidated bus stops nearby)
          enhance comfort for seniors and families. In Kyoto’s city center, sidewalk widening and improved
          waiting areas reduced conflicts at bus stops and increased pedestrian volumes after completion,
          illustrating how small public-realm tweaks amplify social use of adjacent Shotengai.

        <h2>5. Fieldwork &amp; Methods — From Street Segments to Walk-Time Access</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Study Design</h3>
        <p>
          The study combines <strong>on-site observation</strong> with a <strong>reproducible GIS pipeline</strong> to
          examine how
          morphology (continuity, frontage) relates to practical access (5/10/15-minute walks). Kyoto is used as the
          primary
          case study due to its historic grid, concentration of Shotengai (商店街), and availability of civic data.
          <!--  -->
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Guiding question:</strong> How do covered continuity, frontage density, and access nodes interact to
          shape
          everyday walkability in Shotengai? <!--  -->
        </div>

        <h3>5.2 Data Sources</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OpenStreetMap</strong> — pedestrian network, building footprints, POIs (cleaned &amp; filtered).
            <!--  -->
          </li>
          <li><strong>Municipal open data</strong> — zoning/land-use, population mesh where available (Kyoto city
            portals). <!--  --></li>
          <li><strong>Field surveys</strong> — coverage breaks, frontage use (retail/service/residential), vacancy,
            doors/50 m. <!--  --></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Corridor Digitization &amp; Segmentation</h3>
        <p>
          Candidate Shotengai were traced as <em>centerline segments</em> aligned to the pedestrian network. Each
          corridor was
          split into <strong>continuous coverage units</strong> (A-type: covered; B/E-type: uncovered/edge cases), with
          a unique ID
          per segment. Breaks at intersections or roof discontinuities were explicitly coded to capture micro-morphology
          that
          affects comfort. <!--  -->
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>5.4 Network Preparation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Graph cleaning:</strong> remove non-walkable edges, resolve dangling links, enforce crossings
            where observed. <!--  --></li>
          <li><strong>Topology checks:</strong> snap corridor centerlines to the pedestrian graph; ensure node degrees
            are valid at junctions. <!--  --></li>
          <li><strong>Access nodes:</strong> define <em>entry points</em> at station/bus stops and key intersections
            contiguous with Shotengai. <!--  --></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.5 Isochrone Modelling (5/10/15 min)</h3>
        <p>
          From each access node, walking isochrones were computed for 5, 10, and 15 minutes using network costs
          calibrated to
          observed speeds and pedestrian priority. Overlapping sheds were dissolved to identify <em>synergy zones</em>
          between
          corridors. Outputs were stored as polygons and indexed to corridor segments for analysis. <!--  -->
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>5.6 Frontage &amp; Vacancy Survey</h3>
        <p>
          A structured street-edge survey recorded <strong>frontage use</strong> (retail/service/residential),
          <strong>openings/50 m</strong> (as
          a proxy for permeability), and <strong>vacancy</strong> (temporarily closed or unlet frontage). Observations
          were geotagged
          and aggregated by segment to align with coverage continuity. <!--  -->
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frontage density:</strong> count doorways per 50 m.</li>
          <li><strong>Frontage quality index:</strong> edge smoothness, transparency, detail, material, maintenance,
            accessibility. <!--  --></li>
          <li><strong>Vacancy rate:</strong> vacant frontage length / total frontage length per segment. <!--  --></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.7 Indicators &amp; Scoring</h3>
        <p>
          Indicators were standardized (z-scores) and combined into a composite <strong>walkability score</strong>
          (1–7),
          emphasizing <em>continuity</em>, <em>frontage density/quality</em>, and <em>access overlap</em>. Jenks natural
          breaks were
          used for classing maps and summary graphics. <!--  -->
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Key variables:</strong> Continuity index (m of unbroken coverage); Frontage density (doors/50 m);
          Frontage quality (S–C scale); Access overlap (area of 10-min sheds shared by ≥2 nodes). <!--  -->
        </div>

        <h3>5.8 Analytical Steps (Reproducible Workflow)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Digitize corridors &amp; segment by coverage; assign IDs. <!--  --></li>
          <li>Prep pedestrian network; snap centerlines; define access nodes. <!--  --></li>
          <li>Generate 5/10/15-minute isochrones; dissolve overlaps. <!--  --></li>
          <li>Survey frontage use/quality; compute vacancy and doors/50 m. <!--  --></li>
          <li>Join indicators to segments; compute composite score and classed maps. <!--  --></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>5.9 Tools &amp; Formats</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>QGIS</strong> — digitizing, cartography, and overlays. <!--  --></li>
          <li><strong>PostGIS/pgRouting</strong> — network prep and cost-distance. <!--  --></li>
          <li><strong>Notebooks (Python/GeoPandas)</strong> — QA/QC and batch stats. <!--  --></li>
          <li><strong>GeoPackage</strong> — corridor segments, access nodes, isochrones, survey tables with metadata.
            <!--  -->
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.10 Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          Results reflect conditions during the survey window and rely on OSM completeness for non-core streets.
          Isochrone thresholds use average walking speeds and do not capture micro-delays (signals, crowding).
          Nevertheless, the combined approach is sufficient to compare relative morphology–access patterns across
          corridors and to guide more detailed local studies. <!--  -->

      <!-- 6. FINDINGS -->
      <section id="findings">
        <h2>6. Spatial Findings — What the Data Says About Shotengai (商店街)</h2>

        <p>
          This section summarizes the main empirical patterns observed in the study:
          how <em>continuity</em> (unbroken covered length), <em>frontage</em> (density/quality),
          and <em>access</em> (5/10/15-minute walk sheds) interact to shape everyday use.
          Findings draw from the Kyoto case while remaining applicable to similar corridors elsewhere in Japan.
          <!--  -->
        </p>

        <h3>6.1 Continuity strengthens perceived and practical access</h3>
        <p>
          Segments with longer, unbroken coverage align with more comfortable walking conditions and
          steadier footfall. Where coverage is continuous across several blocks, people are more likely
          to chain trips (e.g., errands + meals), which in turn supports a wider mix of frontage uses.
          Short, intentional thresholds at small intersections did not show the same negative effect as
          long breaks. <!--  -->
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Continuity acts as “friction control” — keeping weather, noise, and crossing stress
          low so that a 10-minute walk feels shorter and more purposeful. <!--  -->

        </figure>

        <h3>6.2 Frontage density &amp; quality correlate with vibrancy</h3>
        <p>
          Segments with many doorways per short distance (e.g., per 50 m) and high-quality edges
          (transparent façades, good lighting, well-kept materials) consistently presented richer
          street life in observations. Frontage variety (clinic, grocery, services) helps distribute
          activity across the day. <!--  -->
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Field note:</strong> In practice, frontage quality and density are easier to steward than
          macro-location;
          they can be improved incrementally by associations and owners. <!--  -->
        </div>

        <h3>6.3 Vacancy clusters around long breaks and weak permeability</h3>
        <p>
          Vacant shopfronts tended to cluster near long coverage gaps or abrupt corridor endings,
          especially where the surrounding street network offered fewer alternative paths.
          Where permeability was high (short blocks, multiple cross-routes), vacancies were more dispersed
          and shorter-lived. <!--  -->
        </p>

        <h3>6.4 Access nodes and overlapping sheds extend the corridor’s reach</h3>
        <p>
          Access nodes (駅前や主要交差点) anchor walk-time isochrones. Overlaps between 10-minute sheds indicate
          where multiple nodes jointly serve nearby neighborhoods. In Kyoto’s center, overlaps between adjacent
          corridors amplify the practical reach of each Shotengai beyond its physical length. <!--  -->

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>6.5 Indicators &amp; composite reading</h3>
        <p>
          To compare segments consistently, the study standardized key indicators (continuity, frontage density/quality,
          and access overlap) and read them together in maps and tables. This composite view helps reveal
          “quiet strengths” (e.g., average continuity but very strong frontage) versus “latent risk” segments
          (e.g., good access but long uncovered breaks). <!--  -->

      <!-- 7. CHALLENGES -->
      <section id="challenges">
        <h2>7. Challenges — Managing Decline and Transition in Shotengai (商店街)</h2>

        <p>
          Despite their cultural and spatial resilience, many <em>Shotengai (商店街)</em> face
          structural challenges linked to Japan’s demographic, economic, and technological shifts.
          This section outlines key issues identified in the Kyoto case study and comparable
          corridors nationwide.
        </p>

        <h3>7.1 Demographic change and aging proprietors</h3>
        <p>
          Japan’s aging population directly affects neighborhood retail: many shop owners are over 60,
          and succession to younger generations is uncertain. Interviews in Kyoto highlighted both
          emotional and financial barriers to transferring ownership, including limited heirs,
          renovation costs, and unfamiliarity with digital tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result can be a slow “passive vacancy”: shorter opening hours, storage-only use,
          and eventual closure. This gradual decline is hard to capture statistically yet strongly
          shapes a corridor’s rhythm and perception.
        </p>

        <h3>7.2 Retail restructuring and consumer behavior</h3>
        <p>
          Post-1990 deregulation, convenience-store chains, suburban malls, and e-commerce
          redirected spending away from traditional corridors. Younger consumers favor larger
          selections and car access, while online retail erodes impulse purchases once captured
          by local shops. Even so, Shotengai retain a niche in trust-based, proximity-dependent
          services: clinics, dry cleaners, greengrocers, barbers, and small eateries.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Observation:</strong> Resilience depends on everyday necessity, not luxury.
          Corridors with higher shares of daily-needs retail exhibit slower vacancy growth even
          under macro-level decline.
        </div>

        <h3>7.3 Physical fragmentation and maintenance burden</h3>
        <p>
          Canopies and lighting installed during the 1960s–80s now require expensive maintenance.
          Fragmented ownership of roof segments complicates coordinated repair, producing patchwork
          quality that undermines perceived continuity. Uneven pavement, dated signage, and
          accessibility gaps deter seniors—the demographic most dependent on nearby shops.
        </p>

        <h3>7.4 Policy and institutional gaps</h3>
        <p>
          While national and municipal programs support revitalization, eligibility often favors
          large, centrally located corridors. Smaller neighborhood Shotengai may lack capacity to
          apply or meet thresholds. Coordination between planning and economic-development
          departments is inconsistent, so accessibility and continuity data are rarely integrated
          into retail policy and streetscape projects.
        </p>

        <h3>7.5 Changing urban form</h3>
        <p>
          Station-area redevelopment and land consolidation can erase small parcels and introduce
          large footprints. Where replacement buildings add blank façades or deep setbacks,
          frontage density drops and the fine-grain cadence that sustains walkability is disrupted.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="/images/challenges-redevelopment.jpg"
            alt="Redevelopment near a shotengai that reduces frontage continuity and fine grain">
          <figcaption>
            Redevelopment can improve infrastructure but risks breaking the small-lot rhythm essential to
            Shotengai identity and everyday walkability.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>7.6 Association capacity and volunteer fatigue</h3>
        <p>
          Merchant associations rely on a handful of senior volunteers. Participation has declined as
          younger generations work outside retail or live farther away. Meeting quorum, coordinating
          cleaning, and running festivals requires increasing effort from fewer people—raising
          sustainability concerns for street governance.
        </p>

        <h3>7.7 Digitalization and visibility</h3>
        <p>
          E-commerce challenges physical retail, but digital tools can also expand visibility.
          Some associations experiment with shared websites, QR promotions, and delivery partnerships,
          yet skills and funding remain uneven, leaving many corridors without reliable online
          representation.
        </p>

        <h3>7.8 Synthesis: a multi-layered process</h3>
        <p>
          Decline is rarely uniform. Within a single corridor, segments may be thriving, stagnant,
          or fading. Recognizing this mosaic enables targeted interventions—roof repair here,
          tenant-succession support there—rather than blanket redevelopment.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Planner’s note:</strong> Treat decline as transformation, not disappearance.
          Small, continuous repairs—physical and social—sustain viability better than large one-off resets.

        <h2>8. Revitalization &amp; Future Prospects — Caring for Shotengai (商店街)</h2>

        <p>
          Revitalization succeeds when it treats Shotengai (商店街) as both <em>infrastructure</em> and
          <em>community practice</em>. Building on the study’s findings (continuity, frontage, access),
          this chapter outlines practical strategies that merchant associations, municipalities,
          and partner organizations can implement—beginning with small, compoundable steps.
        </p>

        <h3>8.1 Principles for action</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Continuity first:</strong> Fix small breaks in coverage and path legibility before large projects.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Edge stewardship:</strong> Prioritize frontage density/quality—doorways, lighting, transparency.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Design for overlaps:</strong> Invest where 10-minute sheds overlap to knit corridors and
            neighborhoods.</li>
          <li><strong>Local governance:</strong> Strengthen shōtenkai (商店会) capacity with predictable micro-funding.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Measure &amp; iterate:</strong> Track a small indicator set; adjust quarterly, not once a decade.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If a repair, policy, or program raises the composite walkability score
          (continuity × frontage × access), it likely advances social and economic outcomes too.
        </div>

        <h3>8.2 Physical interventions (low-cost, high-impact)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Roof seam repairs &amp; mini-spans:</strong> Bridge short uncovered gaps at intersections to
            maintain visual and climatic continuity.</li>
          <li><strong>Lighting refresh:</strong> Replace inconsistent fixtures with uniform, warm LED lighting;
            add façade washing at corners for night legibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Pavement &amp; thresholds:</strong> Smooth level changes; widen pinch points; apply tactile cues
            at crossings for barrier-free comfort.</li>
          <li><strong>Wayfinding stack:</strong> Lightweight signs at entries and overlap zones; consistent iconography
            for toilets, clinics, and transit.</li>
          <li><strong>Greening &amp; shade:</strong> Planters and slim street trees where feasible; coordinate
            irrigation and maintenance with shop owners.</li>
        </ul>

          <figcaption>Start small: seal roof seams, add mini-spans at corners, and refresh lighting for immediate
            continuity gains.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>8.3 Frontage &amp; tenancy (keeping the edge lively)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Micro-tenancy &amp; shared fit-outs:</strong> Divide large or awkward units; offer shared
            back-of-house
            (storage, sinks) to lower entry barriers for new tenants.</li>
          <li><strong>Display &amp; transparency guidelines:</strong> Encourage 60–70% clear frontage, limit opaque
            shutters,
            standardize after-hours lighting to avoid “dark gaps.”</li>
          <li><strong>Succession support:</strong> Match retiring owners with apprentices; pilot rent-to-own options;
            offer
            legal templates through the association.</li>
          <li><strong>Pop-ups with purpose:</strong> Use 3–6 month licenses for test kitchens, student shops, or crafts
            that
            complement daily-needs retail rather than displace it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8.4 Programming &amp; logistics (soft power)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time-based streets:</strong> Pedestrianize weekends or evenings; coordinate delivery windows to
            free
            space during peak social hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Everyday rituals:</strong> Small weekly events (book swap, produce corner) sustain rhythm better
            than
            rare large festivals.</li>
          <li><strong>Micro-mobility parking:</strong> Provide neat, signed parking bays for cycles; reduce clutter in
            the
            walking stream.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8.5 Governance &amp; finance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Steady micro-grants:</strong> Replace one-off, paperwork-heavy subsidies with small recurring
            funds
            for maintenance, signage, and accessibility upgrades.</li>
          <li><strong>Street-level PM:</strong> Designate a corridor coordinator (0.2–0.5 FTE) to manage vendors, data,
            and permits; prevent volunteer burnout.</li>
          <li><strong>Partnerships:</strong> Formalize ties with schools/universities for design studios, surveys, and
            storefront pilots; align with health and aging-in-place programs.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Capacity tip:</strong> A part-time coordinator plus a predictable maintenance budget often outperforms
          large capital projects in long-term street vitality.
        </div>

        <h3>8.6 Digital layer (visibility without displacement)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shared directory:</strong> Simple bilingual website with opening hours, services, and access info;
            QR codes at entries for quick discovery.</li>
          <li><strong>Unified branding:</strong> Logo, palette, and map that foreground daily-needs and barrier-free
            routes.</li>
          <li><strong>Click-and-collect:</strong> Cooperative online orders with in-person pickup to leverage proximity
            without complex delivery infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8.9 Outlook</h3>
        <p>
          Shotengai endure because they concentrate proximity, continuity, and social care in a familiar
          urban format. With steady maintenance, gentle design, and capable local governance, they can
          continue to serve aging populations, new families, and visitors—anchoring everyday life while
          adapting to contemporary needs.

        <h2>9. Lessons for Urbanism — What Shotengai (商店街) Teach Us About the City</h2>

        <p>
          The cumulative evidence from historical, morphological, and social analysis of
          <em>Shotengai (商店街)</em> points toward enduring principles of human-scale urbanism.
          Far from being nostalgic remnants, these corridors represent a living model of
          sustainable proximity, civic cooperation, and adaptable form. Their lessons extend
          beyond Japan to any city seeking to balance density with daily livability.
        </p>

        <h3>9.1 Continuity as infrastructure of care</h3>
        <p>
          Covered corridors do more than protect shoppers from rain—they create stable conditions
          for routine social contact. A street that feels safe and comfortable in all weather
          allows seniors and children to move independently, multiplying informal interactions
          that strengthen social capital. Continuity thus becomes both physical infrastructure
          and social safety net.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Insight:</strong> In climates with intense sun, rain, or snow, micro-climate control can be
          a public-health measure, not a luxury. Small roof repairs can yield major accessibility gains.
        </div>

        <h3>9.2 Fine grain and incrementalism</h3>
        <p>
          The fine-grained subdivision of plots—narrow frontages and independent ownership—creates
          a resilient ecosystem. When one shop closes, another can open with limited capital,
          preserving continuity. Large parcels, by contrast, tend toward monoculture.
          The incremental adaptability of small units sustains diversity and cultural texture.
        </p>

        <h3>9.3 Transit integration and short trips</h3>
        <p>
          Most Shotengai grew around rail or tram stops, forming early prototypes of
          <em>Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)</em>. They demonstrate how daily convenience
          and sustainable mobility reinforce each other: people walk more when basic needs are
          within five to ten minutes of home or station. In this sense, the Shotengai embodies
          the “15-minute city” before the phrase existed.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="/images/lessons-tod.jpg" alt="Diagram of station-shotengai relationship in compact city">
          <figcaption>
            Station-front Shotengai (駅前商店街) illustrate early transit-oriented design: mobility and
            commerce woven into one walkable node.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>9.4 Governance at eye level</h3>
        <p>
          Merchant associations offer a model of <em>micro-governance</em> that manages a public realm
          without excessive bureaucracy. Their scope—cleaning, lighting, events, façade care—aligns with
          the spatial grain of their street. This proximity in decision-making allows faster feedback and
          fosters accountability through familiarity rather than regulation.
        </p>

        <h3>9.5 Data and empathy</h3>
        <p>
          Quantitative indicators—continuity, frontage density, access overlap—describe spatial
          performance, but qualitative insight explains why people care about these streets.
          Combining GIS analysis with fieldwork bridges empathy and evidence: numbers reveal
          structure; stories reveal meaning. Planning benefits when both are mapped together.
        </p>

        <h3>9.6 Global relevance</h3>
        <p>
          Similar patterns appear worldwide: European arcades, Middle-Eastern souqs, Latin-American
          pasajes. Each balances protection, intimacy, and mixed use. Shotengai highlight how
          small-scale commerce can anchor civic identity even under globalized consumption.
          For cities facing retail decline, they demonstrate that cooperation and form—not
          megaprojects—often determine resilience.
        </p>

        <h3>9.7 Policy translation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Urban design:</strong> Treat comfort and continuity as baseline infrastructure criteria.</li>
          <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Embed frontage density and access overlap in walkability audits.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic development:</strong> Support merchant associations as community stewards,
            not just retailers.</li>
          <li><strong>Public health:</strong> Recognize walkable corridors as preventive-health assets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9.8 Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Studying Kyoto’s Shotengai reveals that vitality is rarely about spectacle. It emerges
          from countless acts of maintenance, greeting, and local pride. Cities seeking inclusive,
          low-carbon futures can learn from this quiet durability: build less, care more,
          and keep the distance between everyday needs walkably close.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Closing thought:</strong> The Shotengai is not just a shopping street—it is
          a philosophy of proximity. Its lesson is simple: when people can meet their needs
          within a pleasant walk, the city itself becomes a shared home.

        <h2>10. Glossary — Key Terms</h2>
        <p>This glossary summarizes terms used throughout the page. Japanese is shown in parentheses.</p>

        <h3>Shotengai (商店街)</h3>
        <p>Covered or semi-covered neighborhood shopping street. A pedestrian-oriented corridor of small shops and
          services that often functions as social infrastructure, not just retail.</p>

        <h3>Shōtenkai (商店会) / Shōtengai kumiai (商店街組合)</h3>
        <p>Merchant association / arcade cooperative that coordinates cleaning, lighting, façade care, programming,
          safety patrols, and joint promotions at the corridor scale.</p>

        <h3>Machizukuri (まちづくり)</h3>
        <p>Locally driven, participatory town-making and stewardship. In practice: neighborhood groups, merchant
          associations, and residents collaborating on incremental improvements.</p>

        <h3>Monzenmachi (門前町)</h3>
        <p>Historic temple/shrine approaches lined with shops and stalls that evolved into early pedestrian market
          streets.</p>

        <h3>Ekimae (駅前)</h3>
        <p>Station-front area. Many postwar Shotengai emerged at or near transit nodes to capture commuter footfall.</p>

        <h3>Isochrone</h3>
        <p>Area reachable within a given travel time. In this study: 5/10/15-minute walking sheds from access nodes
          (stations/intersections).</p>

        <h3>Continuity (covered continuity)</h3>
        <p>Length of unbroken roofed segment. Higher continuity improves comfort, legibility, and perceived safety,
          supporting trip chaining.</p>

        <h3>Frontage density / quality</h3>
        <p>Number of doorways per fixed distance (e.g., per 50 m) and qualitative edge traits (transparency, lighting,
          care). Proxies for vibrancy and permeability.</p>

        <h3>Access overlap</h3>
        <p>Shared area of 10-minute isochrones from ≥2 access nodes. Indicates synergy zones where corridors and
          neighborhoods knit together.</p>

        <h3>Passive vacancy</h3>
        <p>Gradual decline from reduced hours or storage-only use to eventual closure—often preceding formal vacancy
          listings.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Reading a Shotengai through continuity × frontage × access helps diagnose issues and
          prioritize care.
